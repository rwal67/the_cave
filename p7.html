    <h4>"Its been on my mind. I had a dream last night, there was a ham and egg sandwich, but all else I can recall is that I ate it, but couldn't taste anything"</h4>
    <h4>"But you know what a ham and egg sandwich tastes like. Or at least I presume"</h4>
    <h4>"Precisely. I know the taste, but still couldn't recall it in the dreamscape. But I could remember what a ham and egg sandwich was. Funny right?"</h4>
    <h4>It's not really funny, this is just concerning</h4>
    <h4>"Anyway, it got me thinking. The mouth and nose act as ever-present- and, I hope for you dear friend, functioning- tethers to this mortal coil. Indulging the senses, we are further cemented in the understanding of being human, attesting to our ostensibly ultimate reality as beings of flesh and bone, with the instincts and needs suited to sustain these meaty vessels. To gather at a table, engaging in the act of a shared meal with others (one of lifes sweetest pleasures, of which I have had little opportunity to partake in these days), there is an onslaught upon the senses that define what it truly means to be human, the obligatory smell, texture, and taste of the food, the conversation had (for better or worse, having all too often been called to “grab dinner some time” with disappointingly scant civility, but rather a sense of tension that can cut through even the most dense, well-done meat ordered) the understanding of any preparation and intention that went into the meal, the music played overhead, the conversations had nearby- all of these- both material pleasures and immaterial sensations point to a practice that has long been in the itinerary of mankind." </h4>
    <h3>Is this guy serious</h3>
    <h4>"From hunks of hurriedly harvested fruits and freshly killed game shared over this new thing called “fire”, all the way to nonverbally commanding chefs with a few taps on a self-order kiosk to sit around a hard, plastic table; we've truly been doing this for quite some time. And what would the future of this practice look like? Sometimes I chew on that, almost considering ourselves lucky, even in spite of the impersonality to meal-sharing today, when brought into comparison with the restaurant-goers of tomorrow; “say, after work, say a good 14 hours from now, want to grab some pressurized, vitamin-rich IV down at that new spot that opened up down the highway?”. How far will we plunge ourselves into sterility! "</h4>
    <h4>it feels like hes been raving about this for hours "Don't you have a stop to get off at?"</h4>
    <h4>"No, I don't have a stop actually, thank you for asking"</h4>
    <h3>We sit in awkward silence for a while before the ping goes off "Ellison District, disembarking"</h3>
    <h4>"dare I say, friend- hence why I am asking you. Are we doing anything these days but merely dreaming of food? And if we're dreaming of food- the very substance that sustains our being, I shudder to imagine what else has become mere dream these days"</h4>
    <h3>I get off board, avoiding eye contact, looking at his shoes on the way out.</h3>
